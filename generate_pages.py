<h2>CBSE Age Eligibility Rules — Overview</h2>
<p>The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) mandates minimum age requirements for each class. The age is calculated as of <strong>31st March</strong> of the academic year in which admission is sought. Schools cannot admit students younger than the prescribed minimum, though they may set a higher age requirement.</p>
<div class="info-box"><p>📌 <strong>Key Rule:</strong> Your child's age is calculated as of 31st March of the year they are seeking admission. If your child turns the required age before or on 31st March, they are eligible.</p></div>

</table>
</div>
<h2>How is the Age Calculated?</h2>
<p>CBSE uses the <strong>31st March rule</strong>. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your child is born on or before 31st March 2019, they can seek Class 1 admission in the 2025–26 academic year (age 6 by 31st March 2025)</li>
<li>If your child is born after 31st March 2019, they would need to wait for the 2026–27 academic year</li>
<li>The school's admission year typically starts in April (new academic year)</li>
</ul>
<h2>What Happens If My Child Is a Few Days Short?</h2>
<p>If your child misses the cutoff by a few days, most CBSE schools will not grant an exception. However:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some private schools have a small grace period of up to 30 days — check individually</li>
<li>A few states have different cutoff dates — Tamil Nadu uses 30th June, Maharashtra uses 30th September</li>
<li>International CBSE schools abroad may follow a September 1st cutoff</li>
</ul>
<div class="warn-box"><p>⚠️ <strong>Important:</strong> Even if your child appears mature enough, always verify with the specific school. Admitting an underage child risks issues at Class 10/12 board registration where CBSE strictly verifies age certificates.</p></div>
<h2>Documents Required to Prove Age</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Birth Certificate</strong> issued by Municipal Corporation / Gram Panchayat (most accepted)</li>
<li>Aadhaar Card with date of birth</li>
<li>Hospital birth record / Discharge certificate</li>
<li>Passport (if available)</li>
<li>Affidavit from parent (last resort, school may not accept)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Age Relaxation for Specific Categories</h2>
<p>Some categories get age relaxation under specific circumstances:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Children of defence/paramilitary personnel</strong>: Up to 2 years relaxation in maximum age for KV schools</li>
<li><strong>Children from remote/tribal areas</strong>: State-specific relaxations may apply</li>
<li><strong>Special needs children (CWSN)</strong>: Age relaxation given — check school policy</li>
</ul>
<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<div class="faq-list">
<div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)">My child turns 6 on April 5th — can they join Class 1 this April?<span class="toggle">+</span></div><div class="faq-a">No. The age cutoff is 31st March. If your child turns 6 after 31st March, they are not eligible for Class 1 admission in that academic year. They would need to wait for the following academic year. Use our calculator above to get their exact timeline.</div></div>
<div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)">Can my child skip a class if they are academically advanced?<span class="toggle">+</span></div><div class="faq-a">CBSE does not officially support class-skipping. However, a child can be tested and admitted to a higher class if the school conducts an assessment and the child meets the age criteria for that class. Board exams have strict age requirements that cannot be bypassed.</div></div>
<div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)">Is the age cutoff the same for all CBSE schools?<span class="toggle">+</span></div><div class="faq-a">The minimum age is set by CBSE and applies to all affiliated schools. However, private schools can set a higher minimum age (e.g., 6.5 years for Class 1). Government schools in some states may use a different state cutoff date. Always check with the specific school.</div></div>

<li>Apply to 3 different KV schools to increase chances</li>
<li>Apply in the very first window — don't wait</li>
<li>Ensure all documents are current and match the service certificate</li>
<li>If you're in Priority 2 or below, check if the nearby KV has historically had vacancies</li>
<li>Track the KVS portal regularly after list publication</li>
<li>If not selected in Round 1, remain active — vacancies arise from non-joining of selected students</li>

<div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)">Is there an entrance test for KV Class 1 admission?<span class="toggle">+</span></div><div class="faq-a">No. KV Class 1 admission is purely age-based and by lottery within priority categories.

<div class="info-box"><p>💡 From 2025–26, CBSE plans to conduct board exams <strong>twice a year</strong> — once in November–December and once in February–March. Students can appear in both and use the better score.</p></div>
<h3>Passing Criteria</h3>
<ul>
<li>A student must score <strong>minimum 33%</strong> in each subject (theory + practical combined)</li>
<li>33% is required separately in theory and practical components</li>
<li>Internal assessment marks are added to theory marks for the final score</li>
<li>No minimum marks required for passing in internal assessment alone</li>
</ul>
<h2>CBSE Class 12 Board Exam</h2>
<p>Class 12 results are used for college admissions and CUET scores. Understanding the exam pattern is crucial:</p>
<h3>Key Changes from 2025 Onwards</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Two board exams per year</strong>: CBSE is introducing semester-based board exams</li>
<li><strong>Competency-based questions</strong>: 50% of paper will have case-based, source-based and MCQ questions</li>

<h2>What to Do if Your Child Fails CBSE Board</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Failed in 1–2 subjects:</strong> Eligible for Compartment Exam in July. Pass compartment to get through.</li>

<h2>Result Checking — How to Check Online</h2>
<ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Subjects:</strong> Physics, Chemistry + Maths (PCM) or Biology (PCB) or both (PCMB)</li>
<li><strong>Career paths:</strong> Engineering (JEE), Medicine (NEET), Research, Architecture</li>
<li><strong>Required marks:</strong> Usually 75%+ in Class 10, especially in Maths and Science</li>

<li><strong>Required marks:</strong> 60%+ in Class 10; Maths recommended if taking Commerce with Maths</li>

<li><strong>Talk to the school counsellor</strong>: Most CBSE schools have counsellors who can guide stream selection</li>
<li><strong>Research career options first</strong>: Reverse engineer — decide the career goal, then pick the stream</li>
<li><strong>Don't let peer pressure decide</strong>: Friends taking Science doesn't mean your child should too</li>

<li><strong>Practice MCQs</strong>: CUET is entirely objective — practice speed and accuracy</li>
<li><strong>Attempt previous year papers</strong>: NTA releases official sample papers and past papers</li>

More than 8 hours leads to diminishing returns and burnout. Quality of study matters more than quantity — a focused 4-hour session beats a distracted 8-hour marathon.</div></div>
<div class="faq-item"><div class="faq-q" onclick="toggleFaq(this)">Should my child join coaching classes for CBSE boards?<span class="toggle">+</span></div><div class="faq-a">For CBSE board exams alone, coaching is not mandatory. Most students who study NCERT thoroughly and practise previous year papers score 85%+. Coaching becomes important if targeting competitive exams like JEE or NEET simultaneously. If your child struggles with a specific subject, subject-specific tutoring is more effective than full coaching.</div></div>

<h2>About cbseparent.in</h2>
<p>cbseparent.in is a free resource built by <strong>Apps Pattarai</strong>, a mobile app studio based in Vellore, Tamil Nadu. We noticed that thousands of Indian parents struggle to find clear, accurate, and up-to-date information about CBSE school admissions, age eligibility, KV schools, scholarships, and board exams — often spread across dozens of confusing government websites.</p>
<p>So we built cbseparent.in — a single, trustworthy, plain-language guide that covers everything a CBSE parent needs from Pre-KG to Class 12 and beyond.</p>
<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>To make quality education information accessible to every Indian parent — regardless of their background, language, or familiarity with government portals.</p>
<h2>The App</h2>
<p>We are building a free <strong>CBSE Parent App</strong> for Android (Google Play) that will bring all of cbseparent.in's tools offline — including the age eligibility calculator, KV admission deadline alerts, scholarship reminders, and more. The app will be free with minimal, non-intrusive ads to keep the service sustainable.</p>
<h2>About Apps Pattarai</h2>
<p>Apps Pattarai (Tamil: "Apps Workshop") is a mobile app studio focused on building useful, India-specific utility apps. Our goal is to publish 100+ helpful apps on the Google Play Store — solving real problems for real people across India.</p>
